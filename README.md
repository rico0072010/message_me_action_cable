# Message me rails 5 application

This is the Message Me application for
[*The Complete Ruby on Rails tutorial*](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/).

## Information

Message me is a small app build for learning purposes. I implemented real time functionality via Action Cable,
and it is extremely valuable experience for me.

Checkout the app on heroku [Message Me](https://message-me-rails5.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

And

```
$ rails db:seed
```

(THERE IS NO SIGNUP FUNCTIONALITY, USE USERS FROM SEEDS)


```
$ rails server
```

[*Complete Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/).
